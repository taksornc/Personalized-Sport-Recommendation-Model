# Personalized-Sport-Recommendation-Model
This project develops a Personalized Sport Recommendation Model using machine learning to recommend suitable sports based on individuals’ physical attributes and personal preferences.
The dataset consists of 296 samples collected from KMITL students through an online Google Form questionnaire and covers 5 sport classes (5 sports): football, basketball, volleyball, badminton, and snooker/pool.
The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, class imbalance handling, model training, and evaluation.
Multiple classification models were evaluated, including SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, using 5-fold cross-validation and a hold-out test set.
The Random Forest model achieved the best overall performance with an accuracy of approximately 83%.
Feature importance analysis shows that play type, height, agility, and jumping ability are the most influential factors in sport recommendation.
This project focuses on model development and analysis only and does not include deployment.
